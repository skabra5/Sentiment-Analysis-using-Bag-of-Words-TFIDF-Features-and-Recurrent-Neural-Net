# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Bag-of-Words-TFIDF-Features-and-Recurrent-Neural-Net
Conducted sentiment analysis on Sentiment140 twitter dataset,in Python, using NLTK, Bag of Words, TFIDF features and Recurrent neural network. 
Performed text preprocessing on the tweets using the Regex library and conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data better.

Sentiment Classification: Started with Textblob's sentiment prediction as the baseline model. Further, used Bag of words & TFIDF features to build Multinomial na√Øve bayes, Support vector machine, Stochastic gradient descent, Logistic Regression and neural network models, to improve accuracy over the base model.
